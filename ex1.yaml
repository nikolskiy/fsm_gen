#    after handling this transition, tick event handler continue to process
#    other transitions.
#    This approach breaks to some extent semantic of an FSM: one event - one transition
#    esp. on conditional transitions.
#    We may restrict fall-through transition handling only to self-loops without 'if',
#    then it is almost the same as to add code of 'do' actions from fall-though transition
#    to all other transitions for this event.
#    Only problem here is when other branches are not taken and we go to unhandled event code.
#    To avoid this mismatch in semantic, we may explicitly update 'do' sections from other
#    branches.
#    But for practice fall-through handling may be very useful: saves code and simplifies sepcification

# type
# -------------

# static type assumes only one copy of fsm per executable
# intended use is creation on program startup and deletion
# on program termination
# state variables are hidden from external code
# all functions work on this hidden state
# i.e. passing of state is not assumed
# only parameters for even handlers

#type: static

# dynamic type allow to have many fsm states
# all functions take explicit state parameter
# and user is responsible for managing data
# for these states

type: dynamic


# -----------------------
# Code generation options
# -----------------------

# these options are not mandatory
# by default names for files are: {name}.h and {name}.c
# without any prolog/epilog sections

# one may specify file names explicitly

#header: fsm.h
#source: fsm.c

# ore even specify prolog/epilog sections
# for extra types and functions

header:
  file: fsm.h

# Data types TODO
#-------------------

# move data types to separate spec and put here only include stmt
# do not generate data type declarations in fsm code

# data types: 'file'

data types:
  - structure1:
     - field1: u8
     - field2: u16
  - structure2:
    - field1: structure1

# data types allocation scheme:
# dynamic - uses ordinary malloc
# fixed - uses preallocated structures
# management: using pointers, using indices
# structure1_ptr strucutre1_alloc()
# void strucutre1_free(structure1_ptr)
# access:
# set(structure2.field1.field2, value)
# get(structure2.field1.field2)
# garbage collection: rc and explicit gc

# main idea is to give simple and efficient memory
# management for small embedded systems

#------------------------
# External functions TODO
#------------------------

# can be used in conditions
# it is responsibility of user to guarantee that theese functions
# are pure
#
# pure functions:
#   function1:
#     result: type
#     inputs:
#       - param1: type
#       - param2: type

# can be used only in effectful-code:

# ------------------
# Events definitions
# ------------------

# Events are central idea of an FSM
# all transitions (state variables modifictions and action code execution)
# are made only on events

# events may have parameters

# TODO: use only defined datatypes

events:
  event1:
    - p1:
        # defaults are useless now for c-langauge
        # but may be useful later for c++ code generation
        int: 0
    - p2: char
    - p3: int
  event2: # no parameters
  event3:
    # event3 should have the same signature to test merging transition handlers

#-----------------------
# Delayed events
#-----------------------

# list of events that can be delayed
# what is a delayed event?
# it is just a closure of the corresponding event handler {fn, data}
# closure is created as an ordinary call to event handler,
# but enstead of handling event, it just returns data to process event
# later elsewhere: void* {fsm_name}_event_delayed(...params...)

# this approach may be useful in fully reactive systems, when you want to
# process external event in ISR as fast as possible to do not miss other
# interrupts. In this case you just create a closure of event handler in an ISR
# and execute this handler later in main event loop.

# if closure cannot be created (maximum is reached) then NULL ptr is returned
# and it is upper code responsibility to handle this situation

delayed:
  event1:
    max: 8 # max possible delayed events of this type
  event3:
    max: 4
  tick:
    max: 16

# give user an ability to explicetely specify merging of parameters 
# delayed:
#   - max: 8
#     events: [event1, event2 ...]
#   - max: 16
#     events: [...]
#   - max: 32
#     events: *
      
# events are not handled immediately, but closures are placed in queue
# then later user can call fsm_process_queue() function
# to handle all queued events
# call: void fsm_queue_event1(...params...)
# queue mostly reuses delayed event structures, so
# if you want to queue some event type, you should define it in delayed
queue: true 

# or create separate management for queue:
# queue:
#   max: 8


# ------------------------------
# How to handle unhandled events
# ------------------------------

# Sometimes there is no transition from state for incoming event
# or transition conditions is not met
# So there is several ways to handle this case:
# 1. Consider this situation as exceptional and halt the program
# 2. Treat this situation as ordinary and just ignore event
# 3. Allow user to specify his own code for handling

# Handler can be common for all events
# ignore/halt are self-descriptional

#unhandled events: ignore
unhandled events: halt

#unhandled events: |
#  // user can place here specific code
#  // for handling unhandled events
#  // all state variables are accessible
#  // and extra __state_name and __event_name strings are
#  // passed to this code (for logging or debug purposes))

# Also reaction for unhadled events may be
# specialized depending of event
# just specify a dict with events names with
# corresponding reactions
# '*' name is reserved as default reaction for other
# events, which are not mentioned in dict 

#unhandled events:
#  event1: ignore
#  event2: |
#    // user code as for common handlers
#  *: ignore

# --------------------------
# state variables definition
# --------------------------

# There is one extra hidden variable is added
# to track current state

state variables:
  count: int
  ticks: # with initial values
    char: 0
  edge:
    char: 0

# ------------------------------------------
# Optionsl Initialization & deinitialization
# ------------------------------------------

# User may define specific actions on FSM creation/destroy
# to handle some complex initialization of state variables
# or making some side effects

init: |
  // user specific code is called after setup
  // of initial values for state variables
  // i.e. state variables are already initialized
 
deinit: |
  // specific actions on fsm deallocation/deinitialization
  // state variables are still accesible here
  // FSM data should not be deallocated yet

# ------------------
# States definitions
# ------------------

# Each state can have optional entry/exit actions
# Enter actions are executed after transition actions and
# exit actions are executed befor transition actions

# So if transition is switching FSM from state1 to state2 then
# sequence is:
# 1. Execute state1 exit actions if any
# 2. Execute transition actions if any
# 3. Execute state2 enter actions if any
# 4. return control to ecent handler caller

states:
  state1:
  state2:
  state3:
    enter: |
      // do some actions on enter state
      // state variables are accessible here
      // they are modified by transition actions
      // hidden state num variable are set to this state
      // enevt parameters are not accessible (abviouslu)
    exit: |
      // some actions on state exit
      // hidden state num variable points to this state
      // all state variables are accessible and untoched by
      // transisition actions (transition actions were not executed yet)

# Mandatory definition of initial state
initial state: state3


# -------------------------
# Transitions
# -------------------------

# The most interesting part of FSM specification

# Transitions are organized as list, to keep linear order
# Order implicitly defines priority: if several transitions are enabled,
# then upper one (in this list) will be executed

# transition conditions in 'if' sections are assumed pure functional, ie
# without any side-effects (no ++X, Y--, calls to impure functions, etc)

transitions:

  # hope this defintion id self-descriptionary
  - from: state1
    to: state2
    when: event1
    if: count < 10
    do: |
      count++;
      ticks--;
      edge=23;
      delay_event3(1,2,3);

  # we may define several transitions in one definition
  # actually, next defintion is shortcut for two:
  # - from: state1
  #   ...
  # and
  # - from: state2
  #   ...
  
  - from: [state1, state2]
    to: state2
    when: event1
    if: count < 10
    do: |
      count++;
      ticks--;
      edge=3;
      delay_tick();

  # we may ommit 'to' in defintion
  # in this case transition is treated as loop to the stste itself
  # so no entry/exit state code are executed
  - from: state1
    when: event2

  # we may add loops to several states at once
  # here are two rules in action:
  # 1. expanding 'from' and generating several definition, as was explained erlier
  # 2. applying rule of absent 'to' field, as in previous transition
  - from: [state1, state2]
    when: tick
    do: |
      ticks++;

  # we may add transition to all stated, just fully ommiting 'from'
  # so next defintion is adding self-loops on event 'tick'
  # (note absence of 'to' field) for all states
  - when: tick
    do: |
      ticks+=5;
      printf("%d\n", ticks);

  # here is the trickiest definition
  # if actually defines four transitions:
  # 1. state1->state3 on event1
  # 2. state1->state3 on event3
  # 3. state2->state3 on event1
  # 4. state2->state3 on event3
  # BUT NB!: event1 and event3 parameters must be exactly the same
  #          because all these transitions efectively share the same 'do' section
  #          we may loose requirements for definitions without 'do' section, but
  #          it may lead to some mess, because of different semantic handling of
  #          defitions depending on presence of 'do' section, which might be undesirable
  - from: [state1, state2]
    to: state3
    when: [event1, event3]
